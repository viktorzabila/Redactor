## Instructions
Welcome to the Website Editor Code Exam! üëæ

In this assignment, you‚Äôll be creating a simple website editor shown in the video below. This repo includes a static version of the editor with all its elements, states, and styles. Your task is to make it interactive. There‚Äôs no need to integrate with a backend.

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Video Example](./public/editor-demo.mp4)

## Getting Started
- make sure you use Node v14+
- `npm install`
- `npm start` and wait for the Gallery page to open in Chrome


## Steps

We advise you to approach the task in the following order:

1. Decide how you‚Äôre going to represent the data.
2. Render the grid with a few text blocks.
3. Allow selecting rows and columns.
4. Display sidebar sections for the selected item.
5. Allow adding rows, columns, and text.


## Notes

- Refer to the video as to how things should work.
- It‚Äôs ok if you don‚Äôt finish everything. We mainly want to see how you divide the problem into parts and define interactions between them. Are control flow and data flow easy to follow? Is naming clear? Does your code make it easy to add new features, such as the ability to delete rows or change their order?
- Feel free to add libraries and change any files you want. Don‚Äôt be limited by the current project structure or existing components.
- Note that the code quality is more important than simply passing the step. Do your best to make the implementation clean, modular, well organized, and easy to understand.
- Don‚Äôt worry about performance optimization.
- Good luck! ‚úåÔ∏è
